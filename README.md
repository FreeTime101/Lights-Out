# Lights-Out
 A practice project aims to recreate the [*Lights Out*](https://www.logicgamesonline.com/lightsout/) game.

## What is Lights Out and How to play?
*Lights Out* is an electronic puzzle by *Tiger Toys* consists of a 5Ã—5 grid of buttons which also have lights in them. By pressing a button, its light and those of the (non-diagonally) adjacent buttons will change (switch on if it was off, and vice versa). Given a pattern of lights, you have to switch them all off by pressing the correct buttons. Not only that, but you have to do it in as few moves as possible.[^1]

## Controls
- `Left Mouse Button` - Press the light button
- `Z` - Start a new game
